    "Before we begin even looking at the data, it is important to understand the process that generates the data. When teaching machines to learn from data, we must ourselves understand the biases, limitations, and corruption present in the data we use to teach them. Once we understand the story of how the data came to be, we can take the necessary steps to mitigate bias or corruption in the dataset or explicitly call out these issues when using our trained ML technology. If we do not look into the story of the data, we will inadvertently end up teaching our machines to identify patterns related to the data collection methodology rather than the actual phenomenon the data is seeking to measure, and our findings will be biased.\n",
